## My Setup

After installing and changing a Linux distro, I spend much time installing my favorite applications and config my favorite setup. Most of the time I forget my settings and applications and spend more time to find them. it takes me crazy. So I have decided to create a list of my applications list and their configurations. I try to make it complete step by step and write software and commands which install applications and config my system automatically.

### Current Structure

**apt**:

application list, `packages.txt` are list of applications which are installed with package manager and `other.txt` are list of applications which I must install them manullay.

**config**

application config files. like `i3wm, tmux, etc`

**nvim**

nvim 0.6.1 settings. some config to use nvim easier

**vscode**

vs-code user settings and shortcut settings, and list of vs-code extensions
